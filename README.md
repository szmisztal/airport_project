# Airport Project

## Project Description
Airport Project is a Python application that operates on a server-client architecture, where the server acts as the airport, and each client connecting to the server is treated as an aircraft.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**: The primary programming language used for implementing the project.
- **Threading**: Utilized for handling multiple tasks concurrently, including monitoring aircraft traffic and managing them.
- **Matplotlib**: A Python library used for creating plots, utilized for visualizing aircraft positions at the airport.

## System Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Matplotlib, NumPy

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AirportManagementSystem`
3. Start the server: `python server.py`
4. Launch the client (aircraft): `python client.py`
